This project aims at building web-based tools to support the creation and viewing of SensorML descriptions of sensors and processes, and to support the on-demand execution of SensorML-encoded aggregate process.

The project was initiated by the VAST Team at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) and is now also maintained by Sensia Software and Botts Innovative Research, Inc.

This project is related to the OpenSensorHub, SWE Common Data Model Framework, SensorML Process Execution Engine, and SensorML Process Library also on GitHub.
