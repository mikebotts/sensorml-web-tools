This project aims at building web-based tools to support the creation and viewing of SensorML descriptions of sensors and processes, and to support the execution of SensorML process chains.

The project was initiated by the [VAST Team](http://vast.uah.edu) at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) and is now also maintained by [Sensia Software](http://www.sensiasoftware.com) and [Botts Innovative Research, Inc.](http://www.botts-inc.net).

This project is related to the [SWE Common Data Model Framework](http://code.google.com/p/swe-common-data-framework/), [SensorML Process Execution Engine](http://code.google.com/p/sensorml-data-processing/), and [SensorML Profile Library](http://code.google.com/p/sensorml-profile-library/) also on Google Code.
